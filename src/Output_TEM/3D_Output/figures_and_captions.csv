3,page3_fig2.png,Figure 2. (a) HAADF-STEM overview showing epitaxial LCO ﬁlm with growth facets. (b) The atomic resolved STEM image at the LCO/SRO interface supporting epitaxial relationship. (c) Structure model of the LCO/SRO interfaces.
4,page4_fig2.png,"Figure 3. (a) Sharp domain boundary of the pristine sample. (b) Twisted Co plane on the ﬁlm surface after electrochemical cycles. (c) The plane is severely twisted on the surface of the ﬁlm, but the central part remains intact. (d) A crystal model illustrates the twisted plane structure."

6,page6_fig1.png,"Figure 6. Diﬀerent stages of the structure changes from the initial layer structure to the spinel structure from the sample stopped at 4.2 V in a cycle. (a) The initial state showing the rearrangement of tetrahedral site. (b) Later stage shows the rhombus pattern. (c) The ﬁnal state of a perfect spinel structure on the left side, while the right site is still layered structure. (d) Core-loss EELS on the Co-L2,3 edge shows that the Co ions in the spinel structure have its oxidation state lower than original 3+ in the layer structure (red, spectrum from the transformed spinel region; blue, spectrum from the intact triclinic LCO area)."
